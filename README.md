## Accelerated Hover Scroll

Use this jQuery plugin to create horizontal, hover, accelerated scrolling panels.

### Accelerated?

When you hover your mouse toward the edge of the container, it'll scroll
in that direction. The closer you are to the edge, the faster it
scrolls. The max scroll speed and the percentage width of the scroll
gutters are customizable.
